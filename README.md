# WELCOME!

Hello, I'm Gopi, a recent graduated ITI student from Rutgers Universty! During my time at Rutgers, I was mainly focusing my study in the areas of Web Development and Game Development. Feel free to checkout some of my projects here!

# About Me

I am a person who loves to explore! From places in the world to new concepts, I always have a nature of curiousity that only stops once I gain a full understanding of that concept. If you'd like to have a chat about anything relating to my areas of study, I would be more than thrilled to have a conversation!

Currently, I'm seeking oppurunities in the Salesforce field, but I'm willing to explore any opportunities that come my way.
